# PRAAT SCRIPT "SEMI-AUTO PITCH EXTRACTOR"
# This script semi-automates measuring pitch from sound files with labeled TextGrids.  It cycles through a directory
# of TextGrids, finds associated sound files, opens them one at a time, puts the cursor at the midpoint of each labeled
# interval on the specified tier, and prompts the user to either (1) accept the pitch measurement (2) adjust the pitch
# floor/ceiling or cursor position and recalculate, or (3) mark the interval as unmeasurable, before continuing on to the
# next interval or file.  Pitch at cursor, mean pitch in interval, current floor/ceiling settings, timepoint, percent 
# through interval, filename, interval label, and notes are all written to the output file.  By default, the script will
# show a narrowband spectrogram and a pitch track while running, but will not show formants, pulses, intensity, etc.  If
# you want to see additional analyses, change the arguments of the line that starts "Show analyses" (lines 153 & 156).
# VERSION 0.4 (2012 05 25)
#
# CHANGELOG
# VERSION 0.4:  No significant code changes.  Minor changes to documentation.  License changed from CC to GPL.
# VERSION 0.3:	Major code changes to make the script to be LongSound compatible (this also increases efficiency by only
# 		calculating pitch objects for the intervals analysed, instead of whole files).  Added the ability to specify
# 		the length of the viewing window instead of the previous two options of "interval" or "whole file."  Various
# 		minor code improvements.
# VERSION 0.2:	Added option to append to a pre-existing output file, and to start at an arbitrary point in the file list.
# 		Added the ability to move to different locations besides the interval midpoint during analysis.  Added file
# 		number, pitch ceiling/floor, position in interval to the output file.  Added running count of file number and
# 		total files to the analysis dialog.  Minor improvements to code and comments.
