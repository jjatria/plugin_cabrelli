Roadmap
=======

1. Move interval boundaries to nearest zero crossing

2. Save all labeled intervals

3. Normalize average amplitude of files to 70dB

   * Maybe use RMS instead of peak normalisation

4. Ramp the first and last 15ms of the file

5. Make measurements per relevant interval:

   * F0 (cc) in Hz and Mel with semi-auto script

   * F1-F3 in Hz and Mel using semi-auto script

   * Relative intensity

   * Duration (absolute and relative)

   * Percentage of voicing

6. Labeling

   * Generate TextGrid per file

   * Pause for labeling

   * Run (semi-auto?) analysis

7. More measurements (midpoints? avg. over segment?):

   * Centre of gravity

   * Standard deviation

   * Kurtosis

   * Skewness
